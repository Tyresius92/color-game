# Color Game

A color guessing game with two modes - easy and hard. 

## Gameplay

In either mode, the user is presented with a random RGB value, and asked to guess the tile with the appropriate color from the grid below. If they guess incorrectly, they are allowed to continue guessing until they get the right one. Incorrect guesses are removed from the board. 

### Easy Mode

The user is presented with three colors. 

### Hard Mode

The user is presented with six colors. 

## Possible Extensions

- Add a scoring mechanic
- Two player mode
- Super Hard mode (9 tiles)
- Boss mode (all colors very similar)
- Add a timing mechanic (how many can you get in 1 minute, etc.)
